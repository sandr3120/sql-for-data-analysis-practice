## Overview
This repository contains practice exercises and solutions for SQL data analysis, based on a course I completed on LinkedIn Learning. The course covered various SQL concepts, including handling missing values, working with dates, common SQL functions, and data visualization.

## Source
This is a forked repository, originally provided as part of the LinkedIn Learning course on SQL data analysis. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning]:(https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-for-data-analysis-22645200?dApp=59033956&leis=LAA). The original repository contained datasets and exercise files, which have been used here for practice and further learning.

## Course Highlights
- **Data Cleaning:** Techniques to identify and handle missing or inaccurate values.
- **Date Functions:** Working with dates for data analysis, including filtering and formatting.
- **Common SQL Functions:** Usage of aggregate functions, string functions, and conditional logic in SQL.
- **Data Visualization:** Basic data visualization techniques using SQL queries.


## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-data-analysis-practice.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd sql-data-analysis-practice
    ```
3. **Open the SQL Files**
   - Use any SQL-compatible database system (e.g., MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL) to run the scripts.
   - Load the datasets from the `datasets` folder and execute the SQL scripts from the `exercises` or `solutions` folder.
